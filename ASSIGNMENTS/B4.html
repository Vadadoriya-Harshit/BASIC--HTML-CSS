			<p> <i> To define a container for an external (non-HTML) application, you can use a containerization technology such as Docker.

Here is a basic outline of the steps to create a Docker container:

Write a Dockerfile: This file contains instructions on how to build the container image, including which base image to use, which files to copy into the container, and how to configure the application when the container runs.

Build the container image: Use the Docker CLI command docker build to build the container image using the Dockerfile.

Run the container: Use the Docker CLI command docker run to start a new container based on the image.

Publish the container image: Optionally, you can publish the container image to a registry, such as Docker Hub, so that others can use it.

For more information and detailed instructions, see the Docker documentation: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
